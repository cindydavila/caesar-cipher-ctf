# Caesar Cipher Decryption CTF Challenge

## Objective
Your task is to decrypt the hidden message in the following ciphertext. The message has been encrypted using a Caesar cipher with an unknown shift. Once decrypted, the flag will be in the format `CTF{<your_flag_here>}`.

## Instructions
1. You have been given an encrypted message using the Caesar cipher.
2. Find the shift used for encryption and decrypt the message.
3. Look for the flag inside the decrypted message.

## Encrypted Message
`Khoor Zruog! Wklv lv d FTF flag.`

## Hint
- The cipher uses a Caesar cipher.
- The shift is a number between 1 and 25.
- The flag is in the format: `CTF{...}`.

## Tools
- You can use Python to solve it by running the provided script with different shift values.
