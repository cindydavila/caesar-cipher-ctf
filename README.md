# Decryption CTF Challenge

## Objective
Welcome to the Caesar Cipher Decryption challenge! Your task is to decrypt the hidden message in the given ciphertext. The message has been encrypted using a simple Caesar cipher, where each letter of the plaintext has been shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.
To successfully solve the challenge, you need to figure out the correct shift value used in the cipher, and then decrypt the message.
The flag is embedded within the decrypted message, and it will look something like this:  `CTF{<your_flag_here>}`.
Good luck!

## Instructions
1.	Ciphertext: You have been given an encrypted message. The message has been scrambled using the Caesar cipher.
2.	Key: The cipher is based on shifting each letter of the message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. The shift value is a number between 1 and 25 (both inclusive).
3.	Task: Your goal is to decrypt the message and retrieve the flag hidden inside.


## Encrypted Message
`Khoor Zruog! Wklv lv d FWI iodj.`

## Hint
- The cipher uses a Caesar cipher.
- The shift is a number between 1 and 25.
- The flag is in the format: `CTF{...}`.

## Tools
- You can use Python to solve it by running the provided script with different shift values.
